                Increasing homelessness and an increase in rough sleepers show the Welsh Government, and community is failing to get a handle on systemic poverty, 
                and associated issues.</p>
                <p>
                Cardiff, the capital, has the highest numbers of homeless in Wales with significantly higher numbers of rough sleepers compared to other Welsh cities. 
                According to the Welsh Government, the total counted rough sleepers in Cardiff so far is 64 in 2018/19, almost three times as high as Swansea in second place
                The estimated number of rough sleepers in Cardiff 100, which represents a third of the total number of the 347 rough sleepers in Wales.  
                </p>
                <p>
                Homeless people are particularly exposed to various risks from cold and hunger to violence, as well as more likely to suffer from alcohol or drug addiction.
                Homeless people are also more likely to be implicated in a crime, and also suffer from disproportionate rates of sexual assault.
                Last winter, the homeless people of Cardiff had to reply on tents to escape from a bitter winter, though for some a tent was not enough
                On the 10th of December 2018, A man was found dead in a tent on St. Mary’s street in December last year.

                Deaths amongst the homeless in Wales has developed into a serious social problem in recent years. 
                According to the Office for National Statistics, identified deaths of homeless people has increased sharply since 2014. 
                At least 62 homeless people have died in the last three years many of which could still be alive if they had received adequate physical, and mental health care.

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Homelessness relief rates of cities in Wales</h2>
            <p>Only 34% of homeless people have prevented by the government.</p>

                According to the Welsh Government report, in 2017-2018 - 1977 households in Cardiff were assessed as “homeless.” 
                Of these only 34% were successfully relieved from homelessness, leaving 66% at risk of remaining in occasionally dangerous temporary accommodation or sleeping rough.                 </p>
                <p>
                A Welsh Government spokesperson said, “Tackling homelessness and rough sleeping issue is our priority. 
                We are investing in new homes, protecting our social housing stock and seeking new and innovative ways to ensure that every family has a decent home.”                 </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Women are more vulnerable to homelessness in Cardiff</h2>
            <P>Only 68.7% of female at risk of homelessness received homeless relief compared to 80.9% of men.</P>

                <p>
                The current situation is precarious. Women are more vulnerable to homelessness in Cardiff compared to Wales. 
                During the last year, only 68.7 % of applications for homeless relief where granted, compared to the 80.9% rate for Men. 
                This is a significant outlier for Wales generally.                   
                </p>
                <p>
                Rhiannon Wozencroft, support team manager of Cardiff YMCA Housing Association said, “homeless women over 25 years old are increasing in recent years and many of them have experienced family breakdowns.
                This is an important issue that can affect both women and their children.”

                    “In 2016-2017, 10,407 women in Wales asked for help with homelessness. Many of them were single parents or pregnant, putting a significant number of children at risk of homelessness as well. Women homeless are also exposed to the sexual harassment or violence, and abuse on the streets. For them, living in a mixed-gender accommodation is not a proper option,” said name, Communication Officer of Cardiff Llamau.

                Some argue that the government does not properly reflect the voices of homeless people in its policies       
                Rebecca Jackson, Policy research officer of Shelter Cymru said, “When you are hearing the same story almost every person you speak with, you have to take that on board. 
                I think there is a real issue with the voices of people sleeping rough not being valued by a local authority.
                If you are providing homelessness services and not listening to your homeless clients, this is why arguably you are not very effective.”
                </p>
                <p>
                Rebecca added, “If some organisations say there are ‘empty spaces’ for homeless people, and if it is talking about floor space, that is not an appropriate offer.
                Cardiff Council’s response to him dying on St. Mary’s Street was “This person has a tenancy,” but he had just been released from hospital because a raging addiction and he had said to me that he didn’t want to go into his flat where he had no gas, no electric, no food, and he didn’t know anyone there.”  
                </p>
                <p>
                Providing places to sleep for the homeless is not a comprehensive solution. Whether Homeless people have different issues and the government is failing provide them with practical support.                  
                </p>
                <p>
                “The people on the street are people that we’ve housed, but their connections are with a group of people on the street. So what we’re trying to do is find diversionary activities to build their confidence. 
                It can’t just be getting people trained for work,” said Lynda Thorne, Councillor for Grangetown & Cabinet member Housing & Communities, Cardiff Council.
