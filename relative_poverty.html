                    <p>
                        Many people living in Wales are caught in poverty. They need to spend most of their time to
                        worry
                        about paying rent and bills as well as buying meals and essentials.

                        The report ‘UK Poverty: Causes, Costs and Solutions’ published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation
                        defined poverty as a situation where someone’s income, financial assets are well below those
                        required to meet their minimum needs including food, clothing, shelter, and a basic level of
                        participation in society.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Absolute poverty</strong> – A condition where household income is below a
                                necessary level to
                                maintain
                                basic living standards (food, shelter, housing). This condition makes it possible to
                                compare
                                between
                                different countries and also over time.</li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Relative Poverty</strong> – A condition where household income is a certain
                                percentage below median
                                incomes. For example, the threshold for relative poverty could be set at 50% of median
                                incomes (or
                                60%).
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Joseph Rowntree Foundation’s report "UK poverty: Causes, costs and solutions" (2016)
                        identified
                        five factors that contribute to poverty:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Low wages, insecure jobs, and unemployment;</li>
                            <li>Lack of skills;</li>
                            <li>Ineffective benefit system;</li>
                            <li>High costs;</li>
                            <li>Family problems.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The compounded effects of these issues tend to create a poverty cycle, due to which more
                        vulnerable individuals will face significant challenges to find a job, secure housing, or access
                        training or education.

                    <p>The causes of poverty are numerous, but unemployment, low wages, lack of skills, housing costs,
                        and family breakdowns are considered to be leading causes.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In Wales, in particular, many people are struggling to escape from poverty because of the
                        long-term local economic recession and the impact of austerity and welfare reform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both absolute and relative poverty tend to be higher in Wales compared with the UK average. The
                        data adjusted for housing costs shows a similar trend. Wales’ relative poverty rate after
                        housing costs in 2015-2018 was 24% which is 2% higher than that of the UK.

                    <h2 class="content-subhead">Child poverty</h2>
                    <p>Childhood poverty is a fundamental issue in the community. The absolute child poverty rate in
                        Wales was 16% recently, 1 point lower than that of UK, but the relative child poverty rate
                        was 20%, equal to the UK average. </p>
                    <p>Child poverty is strongly affected by their relationship with parents, so if parents’ poverty is
                        not resolved, this problem will be transferred to the children. For last 20 years, the child
                        poverty rate has not decreased significantly, both in Wales and across the UK.</p>

                        <p>Though children in workless households are an especially vulnerable group, the majority of
                            children in relative poverty actually live in households where at least one adult is
                            working.</p>
                        <p>This is a significant change compared to twenty years ago, when a majority of children

                        poverty could have a devastating effect on the children’s lives. Experts argue that numbers of
                        young homeless are increasing recently because of the breakdown in their relationship with
                        parents.</p>
                    <p>Rebecca Jackson, Policy research officer of Shelter Cymru, said, “We’re seeing increasing numbers
                        of young people. There is a range of factors: breakdown in relationship with parents is one.
                        It’s becoming increasingly difficult to house these young people once they become homeless
                        because they don’t want to be in shared accommodation.”</p>
                    <p>She added that, “When they become homeless again after being evicted from supported
                        accommodation, they are housed in places like Tresillian <em>[the larger adult hostels]</em>,
                        which are
                        not really appropriate for them. There they could develop drug addiction and other issues and
                        end up on the streets again.”</p>

                    <p>Official statistics on poverty were last published by the ONS in <a
                            href='https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/articles/persistentpovertyintheukandeu/2015'
                            target='_blank'>June 2017</a> (which did not include child poverty, according to this <a href='https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/ratesofukchildpoverty' target='_blank'>this Freedom of Information Request</a> ). The Households Below Average Income
                            (HBAI) dataset, published by the Department of work and Pensions and derived from the Family
                            Resources Survey (FRS), is currently the most reliable proxy to measure poverty in the
                            country.</p> <p>First of all, the HBAI only represents part of the population.
                            Notably, it excludes people who are sleeping rough or do not have stable accommodation and
                            people living in institutions, such as prisons and nursing homes.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, its reliability depends on the sample. While figures are considered statistically
                        reliable at the country level, that may not always be the case with regional and
                        sub-regional data.

                    </p>
                    <p>In a <a href='https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23881&LangID=E' target='_blank'>Statement</a> on his visit to the UK, Lord Philip Alston (Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights) urged the British government to
                        adopt an official measure of poverty. Several charities and organisations are also pushing in
                        this direction and publishing their own measures; the <a href='https://socialmetricscommission.org.uk/' target='_blank'>Social Metrics Commission's New Poverty
                        Measure</a> cited in the UN report as one of the most comprehensive and reliable.</p>


                    <p>Income <strong>Before Housing Costs (BHC)</strong> includes net earnings from employment,
                        pension
                        and investment income, educational grants and scholarships, some forms of income in kind
                        (e.g.
                        school meals) and state support, including state pensions.</p>
                    <p>Income <strong>After Housing Costs (AHC)</strong> also includes rent (gross of housing
                        benefits) and
                        mortgage interest payments, but also water rates, community water charges and council water
                        charges, as well as structural insurance premiums.</p>

                    <p>Finally, figures provided by the Welsh Government's Statistical Services (StatsWales) are often
                        <strong>three-year moving averages</strong>. Because the sample is smaller, annual figures would
                        not be as statistically reliable. The upshot is that the figures are not as precise as the
