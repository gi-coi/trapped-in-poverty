                        With their red jacket and a stack of magazines, Big Issue sellers are a familiar presence on
                        streets of Britain. You’ll find them outside the station, near a supermarket or perhaps at a
                        crowded crossroads, inviting passers-by to buy a copy. For Cardiff residents, the faces of
                        Maurice on Charles street or Mark around Queen Station are customary. Yet, not everyone is
                        familiar with “The issue” and what they do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Big Issue started in London in 1991, to support rough sleepers through “a hand up, not a
                        hand out” by offering them a legitimate work opportunity. Vendors purchase the magazine at £1.25
                        and sell it at £2.50, earning a small income as a result.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Even for a well-established social enterprise like The Big Issue, changes in recent years posed
                        a significant challenge. In the past, the organisation recruited most vendors among people who
                        were homeless. Government austerity and cuts to welfare since 2010 however, have taken their
                        toll on British families. Though unemployment is at a
                        record low, the issue is now one of job quality and fairness, rather than quantity.

                        <h3>The Welsh exception</h3>
                        <p>
                            Wales fares considerably worse compared to the rest of the country,
                            with lower incomes and more <a href='relative_poverty.html' target='_blank'>households being
                                pushed into poverty</a>. According to the <a
                                href='https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/householdexpenditurebycountriesandregionsuktablea33'
                                target='_blank'>ONS</a>,
                            weekly expenditure for
                            Welsh households was around £470, much lower than the UK average of £550. <br>
                            Welsh workers also <a

                            salaries
                            grow more slowly. With around £500 per week (full-time gross earnings), up 2.1% from the
                            previous year, Wales lags behind most of the British regions except for the North East
                            (+0.5%).
                            <p>This map shows the average weekly full-time gross earnings by local authority. There is a
                                distinctive geographical pattern of inequality: areas with lower earnings, such as
                                Wales, the North East and the South East, also tend to fare worse in other areas, such
                                as poverty and unemployment.</p>

                    <p>These events have forced The Big Issue Cymru and its South Wales office to reconsider its
                        strategy. “We began noticing new kinds of people coming in, asking for work”, David Rees, sales
                        and outreach worker at The Big Issue Cymru, says. "Some of them were looking for a second or
                        third job; others were not homeless but were unemployed and needed some support while they tried
                        to get back on their feet."
                    </p>

                    <p>The South Wales office initially responded warmly, welcoming the expansion. While providing a
                        job, staff also offered some informal support to find training, accommodation or work
                        opportunities. At one point, however, they realised it was not enough.</p>
                    <h2 class='content-subhead'>Beyond "The Issue": the Vendor Development Programme</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lotty Talbutt, Sales and outreach worker for Big Issue Cymru, spearheaded the launch of the
                        'Vendor Development Programme’, which piloted in 2018. The scheme provided participants with
                        opportunities to access education, skills training and work experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In England, <a href='https://www.bigissue.org.uk/' target='_blank'>The Big Issue Foundation</a>,
                        the organisation’s charity arm, provides this kind of
                        support. But there was nothing similar in Wales. “Four years ago, we ran a programme here with
                        support from the Welsh government, but it was discontinued due to funding cuts”, Lotty explains.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The new project’s focus wasn’t just on employability. Building a person’s confidence was just as
                        important as enhancing their skills. This required a creative, all-encompassing approach.
                        “We ran workshops on wellbeing, self-confidence, fighting isolation and anxiety”, Lotty says.
                        One of the most successful initiatives was a drama workshop. Participants could work on their
                        language and presence, while connecting with other people.

                    </p>

                    <p>What made the development programme successful was networking with other groups, charities and
                        business. “The organisation Making Minds got in touch with us to organise a writing workshop at
                        <a href='suspended_coffees.html' target='_blank'>The Little Man café</a>. Everyone could take
                        part – we invited other organisations, as well. We
                        wanted to build an inclusive space, a community.”</p>


                    <h3>Addressing the training gap</h3>

                    <p>The programme also presented an opportunity for Lotty to identify some gaps and challenges in the
                        current job market. Many employment schemes are geared to younger people, with an eye to
                        preventing poverty and possibly homelessness down the line. For people who are over 24, there
                        isn’t much on offer. “Many of our vendors are over 40. they often lost their job and It’s
                        difficult for them to re-enter the job market.”
                        Although young people are <a href='housing.html' target='_blank'>at high risk of
                            homelessness</a>, in-work poverty is worsening in
                        Wales. For families with children, having a job is no longer a guarantee against poverty: more
                        than two thirds of children in relative poverty live in households where at least one adult is
                        in work, <a href='relative_poverty.html' target='_blank'>according to StatsWales</a>.
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <img class='pure-img-responsive' src='Graphics/maurice.jpg'
                            alt='Maurice, one of The Big Issue vendors'>
                        <figcaption class='imgCaption'>Maurice, one of Cardiff's Big Issue vendors, lost his job after
                            developing emphysema. At 57, with his health condition, it is very difficult for him to access the job market.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        The Big Issue tries to fill this gap with its ordinary activities and with its pilot programmes.
                        For individuals who leave the job market due to various circumstances – like health or economic
                        downturns –, going back in is no easy task. Acquiring <a href='skills.html' target='_blank'>the
                            right skills</a> for a changing job market
                        is key, but so is regaining one’s sense of self, especially after traumatic events.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “People need to hear good things and believe they are capable. I launched the development
                        programme because there were two vendors on our team who were ready to move on from The Big
                        Issue, but maybe they lacked the right skills and they needed a little help to put themselves
                        out there”, explains Lotty.
                    </p>
                    <h3>A precious legacy</h3>
                    <p>
                        The scheme stopped running at the end of last year, but its legacy remains. Involving the whole
                        team in it was a very important part of the process, according to Lotty. Without it, that
                        project wouldn’t have had as much impact.<br>
                        “We still help vendors with everything they may need. The support is informal, but it’s
                        definitely still there”, Lotty says. Her colleague David adds this is a key part of The Big
                        Issue’s mission: helping people build a path forward, beyond The Big Issue. More than just a
                        workplace, the office becomes a support network. Vendors even founded their own football team in
                        2016. The team competes in the four-a-side league organised by Street Football Wales.


                    </p>

                    <p>

                        In addition, the initiative helped connect people and organisations, laying the groundwork for
                        future events and opportunities. These have contributed to expand the South Wales office’s rich
                        network of corporate partnerships. Firms can purchase subscriptions for their employees or
                        co-sponsor partnership initiatives, like events, advertising, internships and other activities.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The impact this had on individuals is unmeasurable, but it’s definitely visible. These
                        experiences were life-changing for some. Lotty’s voice lightens up when she tells the stories of
                        some of the vendors who took part in the programme. One participant discovered her creative
                        talent and is now writing for theatre; another completed two weeks of work experience at a local
                        business and was eventually offered a job.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class='content-subhead'>The shrinking "soft skills" sector</h2>
                    <p>
                        Austerity has meant shrinking budgets for local authorities and charities alike. With these
                        financial constraints, soft skills programmes are typically the first to be slashed. The recent
                        increase in the number of people needing support has also put significant pressure on
                        organisations’ capabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pursuing a bespoke, holistic approach is certainly more expensive than simply shuffling people
                        through the system, explains Rebecca Jackson from Shelter Cymru. However, investing in an
                        intensive effort may prove more efficient in the long run. “I would argue that, in times of
                        austerity, it’s better to spend money on things that work, rather than spend money on things
                        that are cheap but actually don’t work.”


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Investing on the people who are offering and managing those services is just as important as
                        investing in the people that access them. It is difficult for a business or a charity to be
                        forward-thinking and innovative, when they lack the resources for day-to-day administration.
                        “Making sure contracts are long term and wages are fair is the only way to have services that
                        are good quality”, Ms. Jackson emphasises.<br>
                        Government contracts need to reflect both this holistic approach and a long-term perspective.

                            target='_blank'>Joint commissioning</a> of services is a well-researched approach that has
                        yielded positive results
                        all around the world, especially with housing. With joint commissioning, Clinical
                        Commissioning Groups (CCGs) work together or with local authorities to commission services and
                        offer integrated health and social care. They may share budgets, staff or infrastructure and
                        they plan their action jointly.
                        “Joint commissioning of housing and health has
                        proven particularly successful in several countries, especially when health led the way,” Ms.
                        Jackson explains.
