                        Until 2016, <a href='https://www.facebook.com/brodiescoffee' target='_blank'>Brodies Coffee
                            Co</a> was a camper turned “coffee making bean machine” and its founders,
                        Ian and Danni Brodie, travelled around Wales. Now, it is one of Cardiff’s smallest cafés: a tiny
                        cabin in the Gorsedd Gardens, with a gazebo and a few tables outside. When the weather is not
                        too bad, you can sit there, sipping a coffee and enjoying the view of the recently reopened
                        park.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the years working at Brodies, Ian has witnessed the city change. “We’ve been in the Gardens
                        for almost three years now. Sometimes, a homeless person would come, and I would offer him a hot
                        drink, have a chat with him… I became friends with a few.
                        One of them eventually find a home and a job and came back to tell me about their new life. I
                        was very happy for him.”

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Last winter, things took a turn for the worst. Ian says he noticed a sharp increase in the
                        number of people sleeping rough in the neighbourhood. The winter was brutal, and many were
                        struggling to survive. In January, he launched a new initiative: a suspended coffee scheme.

                        <h3>What are suspended coffees?</h3>
                        <p>
                        Café customers can purchase an additional coffee that will be
                        available for free to whoever needs it.<br>For customers, it is a simple, affordable act of
                        kindness; for owners, it is a way to provide some help and a hot beverage to less fortunate
                        clients while supporting their business.<br>Though its exact origins are unclear, the practice
                        was
                        apparently born in Naples, Italy. It has now spread to several countries around the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2013, John M. Sweeney founded the <a href='https://suspendedcoffees.com/'
                            target='_blank'>Suspended Coffees</a> movement. The network now connects people
                        and businesses from all around the world and
                        counts more than 1,400 cafés. You can find suspended coffees near you in the <a
                            href='https://suspendedcoffees.com/find-a-cafe/' target='_blank'>“Find a café”</a>
                        section of their website.<br>Next time you go for a coffee, keep an eye out: many of them are
                        not in the Suspended
                        Coffee network.

                </div>
                <div class='pure-u-3-3 interlude'>
                    <p>Customers can either pay for a suspended coffee or donate the free one they get from
                        their loyalty cards, and each donation is recorded. The reaction from customers is
                        overwhelmingly positive. “Many of them told me it’s a great idea. It’s free and easy for them –
                        they’ll just give their free coffee – and I can help the neighbourhood while supporting my
                        business.”

                    <h2 class='content-subhead'>Coffee and creativity: The Little Man Coffee Co.</h2>
                    <p>Brodies is not alone: a few local businesses have come up with their own initiatives to support
                        the community. Sometimes, these arise out of necessity.</p>
                    <p>
                        The <a href='https://littlemancoffee.co.uk/' target='_blank'>Little Man Coffee Co.</a>, on
                        Bridge street, offers its own special
                        suspended coffee scheme. Rob, the owner, calls it “Suspended Coffee 2.0”.
                        “I’ve always seen The Little Man as a place where people can come to work and be creative. In
                        addition to the shop, we also have a space where groups and organisations hold meetings and
                        events. Many of them have been with us for two years, meeting every week… Our Suspended Coffee
                        was born for them.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Little Man’s Suspended Coffee 2.0 began in 2018. In principle, it works exactly as usual: a
                        customer donates a coffee and marks it on a big blackboard on the shop’s wall. The recipients,
                        in this case, are the charitable groups that meet in The Little Man Garage, an events space in
                        Riverside.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “It is a tough call to make, of course; we are managing our customers’ donation and we need to
                        decide if a group is worthy of people’s kindness. We try to support those people who give their
                        time for free, providing them with a neutral space and helping them save some money with our
                        suspended coffees.” For Rob, it’s a way to support people who work donate their time and energy
                        to worthy causes.
                    </p>

                    <p>The Little Man was also a partner in The Big Issue’s development programme and still holds
                        one-to-one training sessions with the vendors. Rob thinks it’s important for local businesses to
                        be involved in the community.
                        <br>“We’re more like ‘the middle man’”, he jokes. “We provide the
                        space for people to meet, hold events and help others. We’re also a safe space where vulnerable
                        people can come in, sit down and feel comfortable. We play an essential part in these projects”.
                        To Rob, it’s important to have a positive impact on the neighbourhood. “I’ve grown very fond of
                        Cardiff; it is a really good city. And I like to see good positive things happening around me.
                        That’s what I try to do with The Little Man – make good things happen.”</p>

                    <p>Private sector involvement has been central in Cardiff council’s efforts to tackle homelessness.
                        In addition to bringing in more private landlords in social housing provision, the council also
                        took part in fundraising initiatives. Last year, when <a href='https://www.forcardiff.com/'
                            target='_blank'>For Cardiff</a> – the local Business
                        Improvement District – launched the fundraising scheme “Give DIFFerently”, the council donated
                        £5,000.</p>

                        Funds would be collected by the Community Foundation in
                        Wales, and organisations and charities could apply for grants up to £750. These would go
                        directly individuals and fund initiatives aimed at reducing or preventing homelessness, such as
                        training and education or help with financial management, according to <a

                        In January, the campaign came under criticism as, allegedly, the costs for setting up the
                        payment points exceeded the donations received, according to <a
                            href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46952714' target='_blank'>documents seen by BBC’s
                            Local
                            Democracy Reporting Service</a>. These costs were entirely covered by For Cardiff and not by
                        donations, <a href='http://givedifferently.wales/#faq' target='_blank'>according to the
                            initiative’s website</a>. By December 2018, the campaign had raised
                        £9,500, of which 5,000 were donated by the Council, but allegedly cost £12,000 to set up. The
                        original documents could not be retrieved for verification.

                    <p>
                        In the 2017 financial year, For Cardiff, the city’s Business Improvement District, spent almost
                        £35,000 on “Homelessness and begging”, its management report reveals; how much of it went into
                        Give DIFFerently is unclear. The organisation refused to comment on this figure.

                    <p>
                        Some local charities that were initially involved in the project later withdrew their
                        endorsement expressing concern. While acknowledging local authorities’ good intentions, Shelter
                        Cymru and Crisis South Wales <a

                        access funds, unless they were already engaged with support services. In a joint press release,
                        the two organisations encouraged councils to address the causes, rather than the symptoms, of
                        homelessness.

                        “We definitely need to engage with other sectors, but then we’ve all got a
                        responsibility to make sure they’re educated and well-informed, and that we’re not reinforcing
                        those negative stereotypes and perceptions”, Rebecca Jackson, policy research officer at Shelter
                        Cymru, says.

                        These resources, they maintain, should instead being invested on making assistance more
                        accessible to those in need. Encouraging the public to direct their giving away from people

                        Partnerships involving local government, charities and businesses can enrich and empower
                        communities. However, sometimes competing interests and priorities can create tensions; the

                        The council, as well as some
                        charities, assert that as long as people live in tents, they will not engage with the outreach
